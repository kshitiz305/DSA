function of dictionary setdefault to set a value if not present and then add the value if present.

we use index and the second last index of a list by using total - index - 1
                                                            10 - 0 -1 (the last index)
BFS -- QUEUE
when we are adding to the queue we are first marking it as visited
when we are removing from the queue we are adding it to the final list or the bfs.


DFS - recursion



to create a multi dimentional array we use list comprehension


        signifies the number of rows
                ||
[[0]*4    for i in range(3)]
   ||
   This signifies the number of elements in each row

here there are 4 elements in each row  and the number of rows is 3 defined by the range

[[0,0,0,0],
[0,0,0,0],
[0,0,0,0]]
